# Fetching remote data

## Fetching binary data with fetch

### Blobs

Blobs are a way of working with file data in the browser. You can convert data from any network URL into a blob, and even create a local URL to use from that blob.

This is how you create a blob:

```javascript
const blob = new Blob(array, options);
```

- `array` : an array of data to put into the blob, like a list of strings
- `options` : the options to configure the blob. The most important is `option.type`, which determines the MIME type of the blob.

```javascript
const blob = new Blob(['<q id="a"><span id="b">hey!</span></q>'], {
  type: "text/html",
});
```

Here are the properties and methods you can access on a blob:

- `blob.size` : the size of the blob in bytes
- `blob.type` : the MIME type of the blob
- `blob.text()` : async method that returns the text of the blob

To create blob URLs for local use in the browser, you should use these two methods:

- `URL.createObjectURL(blob)` : creates a URL for the blob
- `URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` : revokes the URL for the blob, preventing memory leaks

### Array Buffers

Array buffers are a way for which we can write binary data in node and save it to a file.

We can get array buffer versions of binary data like images when we request them by using the `response.arrayBuffer()` async method that lives on the response object.

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://example.com/image.png");
const buffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
await fs.writeFile("./image.png", imageBuffer);
```

### Fetching image data in the browser

```javascript
async function fetchBlobBrowser(url: string) {
  // 1. fetch image data
  const response = await fetch(url);
  // 2. Convert response to blob
  const blob = await response.blob();
  // 3. Create a local URL for the blob
  const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  return blobUrl;
}
```

Getting usable data from a image URL in the browser is a three step process:

1. Fetch the image data using `fetch(url)`
2. Get the blob data from the response using `response.blob()`, which returns a `Blob` object instance of the binary image data.
3. Create a local URL for the blob using `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`, which returns a string that can be used as a URL in the browser.

This is the complete code in action

```javascript
// this allows us to see which runtime environment we are in
const isRunningInNode = typeof require === "function";

async function fetchBlobBrowser(url: string) {
  if (isRunningInNode) {
    throw new Error("Cannot run in node");
  }

  const response = await fetch(url);

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
  }
  // check response headers to see file MIME type
  if (!response.headers.get("content-type").startsWith("image")) {
    throw new Error("Response is not an image");
  }
  const blob = await response.blob();
  const blobUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  return blobUrl;
}
```

### Fetching image data in node

```javascript
const isRunningInNode = typeof require === "function";

async function fetchBlobNode(url: string) {
  if (!isRunningInNode) {
    throw new Error("Cannot run in browser");
  }

  const response = await fetch(url);

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
  }
  if (!response.headers.get("content-type").startsWith("image")) {
    throw new Error("Response is not an image");
  }
  // get array buffer from response
  const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();
  // convert array buffer to buffer
  const imageBuffer = Buffer.from(arrayBuffer);
  // write buffer to file
  await fs.writeFile("./image.png", imageBuffer);
}
```

1. Fetch image data and get back response
2. Get back array buffer of binary data with `response.arrayBuffer()` async method.
3. Convert array buffer to fs-usable buffer with `Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)`
4. Write buffer to file.

## FileReader and Files

If we want to read raw data from files in the browser, we can use the `File` and `FileReader` APIs.

1. Get blob binary data from the network request

   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch(url);
   const blob = await response.blob();
   ```

2. Create a `File` object from the blob.
   - The first argument of the constructor is an array of data to put in as the file contents.
   - The second argument is the file name.
   - The third argument is the options object, which has a `type` property that determines the MIME type of the file.

   ```javascript
   const file = new File([blob], "image.png", { type: blob.type });
   ```

3. Create a `FileReader` object. Listen for the `load` event, which fires when the file is loaded. The file content will be stored on the `event.target.result` property.

   ```javascript
   const fileReader = new FileReader();

   fileReader.readAsDataURL(file); // tells reader to read file as base 64 string
   fileReader.addEventListener("load", (e) => {
     const fileContent = e.target.result; // file content is stored here
   });
   ```

```ts
async function fetchBlobBrowser(url: string) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const blob = await response.blob();
  const file = new File([blob], "image.png", { type: blob.type });

  const fileReader = new FileReader();

  fileReader.readAsDataURL(file); // tells reader to read file as base 64 string
  fileReader.addEventListener("load", (e) => {
    const fileContent = e.target.result;
  });
}
```

### File API

This is the constructor for a `File` object instance:

```javascript
const file = new File(fileContentArray, filename, options);
```

- `fileContentArray` : an array of data to put into the file. This can be a list of strings, or a list of blobs.
- `filename` : the name of the file
- `options` : the options object, which has a `type` property that determines the MIME type of the file.

And here are the properties on a `File` object instance: 
- `file.name`: the file name
- `file.size`: the file size
- `file.type`: the mimetype of the file

### File reader API

We instantiate a `FileReader` object instance like this:

```javascript
const fileReader = new FileReader();
```

The next important thing to do is to actually begin reading the file, and there are several methods which we can use to read the file in different ways, depending on the resulting output we want:

- `fileReader.readAsText(file)` : read the file as text. Only good for text files and other non-binary data
- `fileReader.readAsDataURL(file)` : read the file as a base64 encoded string. Good for binary data like images
- `fileReader.readAsArrayBuffer(file)` : read the file as an array buffer. Returns an array buffer of the file data
- `fileReader.readAsBinaryString(file)` : read the file as a binary string

After you read the file into the specific format you want, you need to listen to the `load` event on the `FileReader` object instance, which fires when the file is loaded. The file content will be stored on the `event.target.result` property.

```javascript
fileReader.addEventListener("load", (e) => {
  const fileContent = e.target.result; // file content is stored here, in whatever format you read file as
});
```

If I used `fileReader.readAsDataURL(file)`, then the `fileContent` variable would be a base64 encoded string.

#### FileReader events

The FileReader API has three events you can listen for: 

- `"load"`: when the file fully loads and is ready to be used
- `"progress"`: fired every 50 ms while the file is loading, giving updates on the progress
- `"error"`: fired if an error occurred during the loading process. 

```ts
fileReader.addEventListener("progress", (e) => {
	if (e.lengthComputable) {
      progress.innerHTML = `${e.loaded}/${e.total}`;
    }
})

fileReader.addEventListener("error", (e) => {
	alert(reader.error.code)
})
```

## Aborting fetch requests

We can use the `AbortController` class to abort fetch requests if they are taking too long.

The main steps are these:

1. Instantiate an abort controller with `new AbortController()`
2. Connect the abort controller to our fetch call by attaching the `signal` property of the abort controller to the `signal` property of the fetch options object.
3. Call `abort()` on the abort controller after a certain amount of time. The previous connection through the `signal` property will cause the fetch request to abort.

```javascript
async function fetchWithTimeout(
  url: string,
  // RequestInit is the interface for the fetch options object
  options: RequestInit = {},
  timeout = -1
) {
  // user has specified they want a timeout for fetch
  if (timeout > 0) {
    let controller = new AbortController();
    // connect controller to our fetch request through the options object and on options.signal
    options.signal = controller.signal;

    setTimeout(() => {
      // this aborts the controller and any connected fetch requests
      controller.abort();
    }, timeout);
  }

  // need to pass options into fetch so that we get signal connection to abort controller
  return fetch(url, options);
}

// fetches google with a timeout of 1 second, aborting the request if it takes any longer
fetchWithTimeout("https://google.com", {}, 1000);
```

Here is a simpler example: 

```ts
let abortController = new AbortController();
 
fetch('wikipedia.zip', { signal: abortController.signal })
  .catch(() => console.log('aborted!'));
 
// Abort the fetch after 10ms
setTimeout(() => abortController.abort(), 10);
```

## Everything you need to know about CORS

CORS is a way around the SOP (same origin policy) that allows frontend webpages to request different origins in a fetch request in a secure way. 

Whatâ€™s to prevent a malicious website from requesting APIs with credentials and using it for malicious purposes? Well you have two policies that protect websites:

- **SOP:** same origin policy states that no other website can access or request resources belonging to another website using AJAX.
- **CORS:** cross origin resource sharing is a relaxation on SOP that allows servers to define rules for which websites are allowed to bypass the SOP and request the websiteâ€™s resources with AJAX. If CORS is not enabled, then only SOP is in effect.

The basic idea behind CORS is to use custom HTTP headers to allow both the browser and the server to know enough about each other to determine if the request or response should succeed or fail.

**deciding to fetch or not**

Browsers have to decide whether they are allowed to make specific AJAX calls to certain websites or not. They do this with a **preflight request**, which makes an `OPTION` request to the requested website and retrieves the server's CORS policy.

Browsers do not send preflight requests and instead allow AJAX calls by default (**safe requests**) in these two scenarios:

1. Making a simple GET request without any custom headers (fetching images, simple APIs, etc.), and the `Content-type` header is one of these three: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,Â `multipart/form-data`Â orÂ `text/plain`.
2. Making a simple POST request without any custom headers or non plain-text content type (form submission) and the `Content-type` header is one of these three: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`,Â `multipart/form-data`Â orÂ `text/plain`.

These are called **safe requests**, and will be carried out successfully if the origin requesting the resource is of the allowed origins in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set by the server.

![](https://javascript.info/article/fetch-crossorigin/xhr-another-domain.svg)

In some cases, a request will send custom headers that are considered unsafe, like "Authorization" or "Api-key", and in that case the request will be denoted as an **unsafe request**.

When an AJAX unsafe request call is made, the browser first performs a preflight check which works as follows: 

A preflight request sends anÂ `OPTIONS` request to the server, with no body and three headers:
- `Access-Control-Request-Method`Â : the method of the unsafe request.
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`Â : comma-separated list of its unsafe HTTP-headers.
- `Origin`Â : the origin from where the request came. (such asÂ `https://javascript.info`)

Then the server should respond with status 200 and these three headers:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`Â with a list of allowed methods,
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`Â with a list of allowed headers,
- `Access-Control-Max-Age`Â with a number of seconds to cache the permissions.

If all of these are allowed by the server's CORS policy, then the request will be made. 

![](https://javascript.info/article/fetch-crossorigin/xhr-preflight.svg)



**deciding to perform the AJAX request or not**

If the browser performs the AJAX request, it then has to decide if it should allow the Javascript code to access the response. The browser will retrieve the CORS policy from the response, and see if the AJAX request conforms to the CORS policy.

If it does, then the Javascript code will have access to the response. If not, the Javascript code will not access the response and an error message is displayed in the Javascript console.

To summarize, the browser checks the CORS policy in 2 cases:

1. Before sending a non standard HTTP requests.
2. Before deciding whether to allow access to the response.

**Creating a cors policy**

To establish a CORS policy so that a webpage can request a server, the server should send back these 4 headers on every response (easily accomplished with express middleware):

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`â€” Determines whether or not the requesting website should be allowed to access the serverâ€™s resources. If the string is set to the origin of the requesting website, then it is allowed. Otherwise not.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`â€”A comma-separated list of allowed methods. If the AJAX request requests the website with an HTTP verb other than from the allowed list, the request is rejected.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`â€”A comma-separated list of allowed custom headers the AJAX request can have. If the AJAX request has a custom header not in the list, then the request is rejected.
- `Access-Control-Max-Age`â€”The amount of time in seconds that this preflight request should be cached for.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: A boolean that determines whether or not cookies from the requested website should be sent over with the AJAX request. This can lead to a bunch of security exploits, however, like masquerading as another user.

Here is an example:

```ts
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.mattfriz.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: FRIZ
Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false
```

**Security caveats**

The most damaging security aspect of CORS is the ability for hackers to masquerade as authenticated users. They can do this by making an AJAX request **with credentials**, meaning that the requested website sends along all its cookies and gives the AJAX request access to all of them.

For example, the below fetch call will gain access to all the cookies of the website it requests, letting it masquerade as a user and then send the request.

```tsx
fetch(url,{
   method:'post',
   credentials: "include"
});
```

Then sending credentials will only work if the server has the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header. 

This is only a problem if authentication is done via cookies, but having authorization be done via HTTP headers like bearer token on requests with the `Authorization` header is much better.

## Requesting data from a server

There are three basic ways of doing several back-and-forth requests between a client and server: 

### Long Polling

For 99% of server and client communication, the client always makes a request to the server. However, there are some occasions where the server needs to notify the client of something. 

When this happens, the client needs to send requests to the server at a constant interval, like every 10 seconds, so that on one of those requests the server can send something back to the client. 

What's the issue? This is extremely inefficient. 

Instead we make use of something called **long polling**, which is where the client sends a request to the server once and leaves the communication hanging until the server responds back with a message. If the request times out, then the client just tries again and hangs. 

![](https://javascript.info/article/long-polling/long-polling.svg)

```ts
async function subscribe() {
  let response = await fetch("/subscribe");

  if (response.status == 502) {
    // Status 502 is a connection timeout error,
    // may happen when the connection was pending for too long,
    // and the remote server or a proxy closed it
    // let's reconnect
    await subscribe();
  } else if (response.status != 200) {
    // An error - let's show it
    showMessage(response.statusText);
    // Reconnect in one second
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    await subscribe();
  } else {
    // Get and show the message
    let message = await response.text();
    showMessage(message);
    // Call subscribe() again to get the next message
    await subscribe();
  }
}

subscribe();
```


> [!TIP] 
> Long polling works great in situations when messages are rare. Otherwise if messages from the server to client are frequent, then it's better to use websockets. 


### Websockets

Websockets are done by connecting to the secure `wss` or the insecure `ws` protocol.

You can connect to a websocket URL by instantiating the `WebSocket` class:

```ts
let socket = new WebSocket("wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/demo/hello")
```

And then the websocket has access to 4 total events:

```ts
let socket = new WebSocket("wss://javascript.info/article/websocket/demo/hello");

socket.onopen = function(e) {
  alert("[open] Connection established");
  alert("Sending to server");
  socket.send("My name is John");
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
  alert(`[message] Data received from server: ${event.data}`);
};

socket.onclose = function(event) {
  if (event.wasClean) {
    alert(`[close] Connection closed cleanly, code=${event.code} reason=${event.reason}`);
  } else {
    // e.g. server process killed or network down
    // event.code is usually 1006 in this case
    alert('[close] Connection died');
  }
};

socket.onerror = function(error) {
  alert(`[error]`);
};
```

#### Sending Messages

Use `socket.send(data)` to send a message. You can send either a string or binary data, which will get encoded into a Blob. 

On the receiving end, the `socket.onmessage()`'s event object will have access to the `event.data` property which is the data sent by `socket.send()`.

#### Closing a socket

The `socket.close(code, message)` method closes the socket connection.  

You can receive the close action with the `socket.onclose` event handler, and access the code through `event.code` and the message through `event.reason`.

```ts
// closing party:
socket.close(1000, "Work complete");

// the other party
socket.onclose = event => {
  // event.code === 1000
  // event.reason === "Work complete"
  // event.wasClean === true (clean close)
};
```

### Server Sent Events

Server sent events are like websockets except the connections are one-way for the server sending data to the client, it's HTTP based, and data is always sent as plain text. 

All data sent from the server to the client will be in the form `data: <some-string>`, and we basically just parse the string that comes after the `data: ` prefix. We can get clever and just send JSON as some string. 

1. Instantiate an `new EventSource(url)` object that connects to your server route that specifically sends back a 200 status response and must send back the `Content-Type: text/event-stream` on this route. 

```ts
const eventSource = new EventSource("/events/subscribe");
```

2. Listen for messages from the `"message"` event on the event source:

```ts
eventSource.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
	const data = e.data
})
```

You can close the connection with `eventSource.close()`. Whenever you want to reconnect, you need to instantiate a fresh object. 

There are three events you can add listeners for on the event source object: 

- `message`Â â€“ a message received, available asÂ `event.data`.
- `open`Â â€“ the connection is open.
- `error`Â â€“ the connection could not be established, e.g. the server returned HTTP 500 status.
