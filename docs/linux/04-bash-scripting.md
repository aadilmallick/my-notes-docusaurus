## Basic bash scripting

### SH files

Bash scripts are simple linux commands run one after the other in the form of a file. They are `.sh` file extensions, and you run such scripts with the `bash` command, like `bash script.sh`

```bash title="script.sh"
mkdir -p brahdir
cd brahdir
touch brah{1..10}
echo "The brah has been planted"
```

### Executable scripts

You can turn simple `.sh` files into executable scripts that you can add to bin with a **shebang**

The shebang is what allows you to turn your bash scripts into executable files and even write them in another language.

It is the first line in a script, and defines the path to the language source for the script.

Bash looks at the shebang, determines the language for that script, and uses the language-specific command associated with that language compiler path like `python` or `node` to run the script.

For example, letâ€™s find the shebang for writing a bash script

1. Use `which bash` to find the location of the `bash` command on your laptop. You should get back `/usr/bin/bash`
2. Type `#! /usr/bin/bash` as the first line of your script to register this as a bash language script
3. Rename your file to have no file extensions.
4. Make the script executable by doing `chmod 777 <scriptname>`

Here is an example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

TEXTFILES="$(ls *.txt)"
for FILE in $TEXTFILES
        do
                wc -w $FILE | cat
        done
```

## Windows Batch Files

Windows batch files are a way of scripting for powershell instead of bash. The best part is, we don't even need to write powershell. All we have to do is call other files from within the batch file.

But why even use batch files? Well, just by pressing the `windows + R` keyboard shortcut you're able to run any batch file that lives on your path in the system environment variables.

- For example, a batch file named `yttrimmer.bat` that lives in a folder added to the PATH will be able to be run by typing `windows + R` and then typing in `yttrimmer` and then hitting enter.
