## Intro

To open vim, run the `vim <textfile.txt>` command to open up a specific command in vim.

To quit vim, first get into **command mode (**if you arenâ€™t already**)** by hitting `esc` twice, and then type and run `:q`. To quit no matter what, run `:q!` .

Basic commands:

- `esc` : toggles between typing mode and command mode. In typing mode you can make changes to your text file. In command mode you can type vim commands
- `:q` : quit vim
- `:w` : save file
- `:wq` : save and exit
- `:qa!` : quit no matter what.
