### Technical Design Documents (TDDs)

TDDs are high-level documentation pieces on how to implement a feature, talking about the purpose, system architecture, data flow, and data structures involved with the feature at a high level.

WHen writing TDDs, you should always start out describing the problem, its scope, and then get into how to solve it and the various different approaches to solving it.

Here are the four components of the TDD you should write in order:

1. **what problem are we trying to solve**
2. **what is the current process?**: optional, only for internal tools.
3. **what are the requirements?**: what circumstances define the problem as being solved.
4. **how do we solve it?**: feature proposal for solving the problem, which correctly achieves the circumstances needed that define the problem as being solved.
