### Navigating the canvas

These are the basic shortcut to navigate the canvas

| move tool  | v        |
| hand tool  | h        |
| scale tool | k        |

#### Shapes

You can create shapes with these shortcuts

| tool      | shortcut |
| --------- | -------- |
| rectangle | r        |
| oval      | o        |
| line      | l        |
|           |          |
|           |          |
|           |          |

However, you can combine them with these two keyboard presses into order to draw the shape differently:

- **shift**: locks aspect ratio to be 1:1 for shapes, or moves lines in 45 degree angles when drawing lines.
- **alt**: draws the shape from the center going out instead of an edge by default.

### plugins
