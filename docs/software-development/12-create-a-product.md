## Validating your idea

### Three reasons why SAAS apps fail

1. **no real problem**: Your app fails to solve a meaningful problem
2. **bad marketing**: Even if your app is good, if nobody knows about it, then nobody will buy it.
3. **no differentiation**: nobody knows what differentiates you from your competitors and therefore you get lost in the sea of similar products.

### The 4 steps to create a winning SAAS

1. Do market research
2. Do audience research, create an audience profile.
3. Define your MVP
4. Run a test marketing campaign to see if people really will buy your app

## Review the market

It's crucial to understand the current market and any competitors in the same space as you, and generate ideas on how to differentiate yourself. You want to broadly define your niche:

1. Define your audience, make sure it's a small initial audience.
2. Define your offering and what would differentiate it from other companies.

> [!NOTE]
> The smaller your initial audience, the higher the probability of success. The more niche your product, the more loyal your audience and the higher your chances of success.


## Product design

### Product design philosophy

Here are three challenges product designers should think about:

1. **Repeated operations**: operations in a web app that users repeat many times can become annoying and so it's your job to figure out to remove the annoyance from those repeated operations by making them easier.
2. **maintaining procedural knowledge**: most users will have some subconscious manner in how they use websites (search bar at top right, hamburger at top left) and you don't want to break that procedural knowledge and increase the cognitive load.

Here are the core things you should do for product design:

1. **market research**: Research your competitors, what they do right, what they do wrong, and how you could differentiate yourself.
2. **making your product user centric**: Your product should have good answers to these three components:
	- **goal**: What does your web app allow people to achieve, and is it meaningful enough that it would be difficult for people to do that thing without your app?
	- **pain point**: What pain point will your product solve for its users?
	- **need**: Is there a legitimate need for the functionality your product offers?
3. **task-orientated**: Answer these three questions to define the functionality in your app and prioritize them in order of how much users care about them.
	- What tasks/functionality will a user be able to do within your app?
	- What tasks benefit users the most?
	- Which are the most-popular or frequently used tasks?

### principle 1) Simplicity

A simple product is a good product. Aim to strip out the complexity from your designs using these three tactics:

1. **delete**: If an element is inessential, see if you can delete it and no web app functionality changes. It's completely unnecessary.
2. **hide**: If an element changes/adds functionality to the web app, then hide the element with the a way to toggle showing it if the user wants more info. Think of like a floating action button.
3. **shrink**: Visually deemphasize inessential yet important elements to let user focus on more important functionality.

### Principle 2) usability

You want your app to be both user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible for disabled people. So answer these three questions well:

1. **intuitive**: is the web app easy to learn?
2. **user-friendly**: is it simple and easy to complete common tasks?
3. **forgiving**: is it forgiving of mistakes? Can you undo mistakes?
