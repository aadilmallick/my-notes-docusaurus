## Validating your idea

### Three reasons why SAAS apps fail

1. **no real problem**: Your app fails to solve a meaningful problem
2. **bad marketing**: Even if your app is good, if nobody knows about it, then nobody will buy it.
3. **no differentiation**: nobody knows what differentiates you from your competitors and therefore you get lost in the sea of similar products.

### The 4 steps to create a winning SAAS

1. Do market research
2. Do audience research, create an audience profile.
3. Define your MVP
4. Run a test marketing campaign to see if people really will buy your app

## Review the market

It's crucial to understand the current market and any competitors in the same space as you, and generate ideas on how to differentiate yourself. You want to broadly define your niche:

1. Define your audience, make sure it's a small initial audience.
2. Define your offering and what would differentiate it from other companies.

> [!NOTE]
> The smaller your initial audience, the higher the probability of success. The more niche your product, the more loyal your audience and the higher your chances of success.
