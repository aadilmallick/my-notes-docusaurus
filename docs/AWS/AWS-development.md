## AWS-SAM

### Intro

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications using infrastructure as code (IaC). With AWS SAM's shorthand syntax, developers declare [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) resources and specialized serverless resources that are transformed to infrastructure during deployment. When working with AWS SAM, you will interact with:

1. AWS SAM CLI - A command-line tool that helps you develop, locally test, and deploy your serverless applications.
    
2. AWS SAM Template - An extension of CloudFormation that provides simplified syntax for defining serverless resources.

AWS SAM is an ideal IaC solution for scenarios where you want simplified serverless development with the full power of CloudFormation. For example, you can use SAM for:

- **Serverless applications:** You can use SAM to quickly define AWS Lambda functions, Lambda durable functions, Amazon API Gateway APIs, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and other serverless resources with minimal code.
    
- **CloudFormation enhancement:** You can combine SAM with existing CloudFormation templates to add serverless components to traditional infrastructure. SAM resources work alongside standard CloudFormation resources in the same template.
    
- **Local development and testing:** You can use the SAM CLI to test Lambda functions locally, simulate API Gateway endpoints, and debug serverless applications on your development machine before deploying to AWS.
    
- **CI/CD for serverless:** You can build deployment pipelines using SAM templates that automatically generate the CloudFormation infrastructure needed for staging and production environments.
    
- **Migration from console-created resources:** You can convert Lambda functions and API Gateway resources created in the AWS Management Console into infrastructure as code using SAM templates.
    

**Comparing AWS SAM with other IaC tools**

- Use SAM instead of CloudFormation to simplify serverless resource definitions while maintaining template compatibility.
    
- Use SAM instead of AWS CDK if you prefer a declarative approach to describing your infrastructure rather than a programmatic one.
    
- Combine SAM with AWS CDK by using SAM CLI's local testing features to enhance your CDK applications.

### Installation

**Linux installation**

You can install this package via brew:

```bash
brew install aws-sam-cli
```

### Basics

1. Run the `sam init` command to create your serverless application and create a project directory.
2. Modify the `template.yaml` file, which is your AWS SAM template.
3. Run the `sam build` command to update the changes you made in the `template.yaml` to produce a new CloudFormation output. When you build, the AWS SAM CLI creates a `.aws-sam` directory and organizes your function dependencies, project code, and project files there.

> [!WARNING]
> The installed Python version must match the `Runtime` property specified in `template.yaml`. For production workloads, we recommend using Python 3.12 or earlier versions that are fully supported in AWS environments. If the Python versions don't match, you'll encounter build errors.

To resolve version compatibility issues:

- Specify a compatible [runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-init.html#sam-cli-command-reference-sam-init-options-runtime) during initialization: `sam init --runtime python3.9`
- Modify the `Runtime` property in `template.yaml` after initialization

### Building and deploying

Run the `sam build` command to build the CloudFormation template from your `template.yaml`

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have Python on your local machine, use the **`sam build --use-container`** command instead. The AWS SAM CLI will create a Docker container that includes your function's runtime and dependencies. This command requires Docker on your local machine.

The following is a shortened example of the `.aws-sam` directory created by the AWS SAM CLI:
    
```
.aws-sam
├── build
│   ├── HelloWorldFunction
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── app.py
│   │   └── requirements.txt
│   └── template.yaml
└── build.toml
```

Some important files to highlight:

- `build/HelloWorldFunction` – Contains your Lambda function code and dependencies. The AWS SAM CLI creates a directory for each function in your application.
    
- `build/template.yaml` – Contains a copy of your AWS SAM template that is referenced by CloudFormation at deployment.
    
- `build.toml` – Configuration file that stores default parameter values referenced by the AWS SAM CLI when building and deploying your application.
    

You are now ready to deploy your application to the AWS Cloud.

In this step, you use the AWS SAM CLI to deploy your application to the AWS Cloud. The AWS SAM CLI will do the following:

- Guide you through configuring your application settings for deployment.
    
- Upload your application files to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
    
- Transform your AWS SAM template into an CloudFormation template. It then uploads your template to the CloudFormation service to provision your AWS resources.

To deploy your application, follow these steps:

1. Run the `sam deploy` command and walk through the TUI.

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```


Here is what happens behind the scenes:

- The AWS SAM CLI creates an Amazon S3 bucket and uploads your `.aws-sam` directory.
- The AWS SAM CLI transforms your AWS SAM template into CloudFormation and uploads it to the CloudFormation service.
- CloudFormation provisions your resources.

### Endpoints

```bash
sam list endpoints --output json
```
